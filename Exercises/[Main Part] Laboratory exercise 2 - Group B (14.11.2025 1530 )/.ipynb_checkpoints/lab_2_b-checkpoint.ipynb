    "## 1. Overview of the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `season_12_data.csv`\n",
    "- `season_13_data.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name**\n",
    "  The name of the champion (e.g., *Ahri*, *Garen*, *Lee Sin*).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**\n",
    "  The gameplay class or archetype of the champion.\n",
    "  Possible values include: **Fighter**, **Assassin**, **Mage**, **Marksman**, **Support**, **Tank**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role**\n",
    "  The primary lane or position where the champion is played.\n",
    "  Possible roles: **Top**, **Mid**, **ADC**, **Support**, **Jungle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tier**\n",
    "  The overall performance/strength ranking of the champion for that season.\n",
    "  Possible tiers: **S+**, **S**, **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend**\n",
    "  The performance trend or momentum indicator (e.g., positive/negative score trend across the season).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Win %**\n",
    "  The win rate percentage of the champion in the given role and season (e.g., `51%`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role %**\n",
    "  The percentage of games in which this champion is played in the **given role** (e.g., a champion being played top lane 80% of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pick %**\n",
    "  The pick rate percentage, i.e., how often the champion is selected overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ban %**\n",
    "  The ban rate percentage.\n",
    "  - This is split by side, e.g., `\"Blue (23%) / Red (34%)\"`, indicating separate ban rates depending on the team side.\n",
